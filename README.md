# Energy-Consumption-Analysis

###Project Title: Energy Consumption Analysis
Technologies:
- Data Cleansing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization (Tableau/Power BI)
## Domain:
Energy and Sustainability

## Problem Statement:
The project aims to analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations. Leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data spanning from 2012 to 2021, the goal is to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement. The insights gained will inform data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

## Data Understanding:
The dataset contains information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards. Key attributes include organization details, operational information, energy consumption data, and GHG emissions.

## Key Features:
- Sector: Represents the sector of the organization (e.g., Public Hospital, School Board).
- SubSector: Provides further classification within the sector.
- Organization: Name of the BPS organization.
- Operation: Specific operation or facility within the organization.
- Address, City, Postal Code: Location details of the organization.
- Energy Usage: Information about electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, coal, wood, district heating, and district cooling consumption.
- GHG Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms.
- Data Preparation and Cleansing:
- Clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing units, and deriving relevant features.
- Segment the data by relevant factors like sector, organization type, and facility size.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Power BI):
- Employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and relevant features like building size, operational hours, and weather data.
- Identify outliers and potential areas for further investigation.
- Develop compelling and interactive visualizations using Power BI to effectively communicate key insights from the EDA.
- Create dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type.
- Design comparative visualizations to analyze performance trends and benchmark organizations against established metrics.
